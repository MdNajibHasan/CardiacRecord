# Project Problem Description

Consider the situation of someone who need to monitor their blood pressure and heart
rate data. We made a simple, attractive, intuitive Android mobile app to track this
data. The app is called **CardiacRecord**.

Specifically, each measurement has the following fields:
* Date Measured (dd-mm-yy format)
* Time Measured (hh:mm format)
* Systolic Pressure in mm Hg
* Diastolic Pressure in mm Hg
* Heart Rate in beats per minute

This app should allow the user to:

* Show a list of measurements.
* Add new measurement.
* View and edit the details of an existing measurement.
* Delete a measurement.
* See unusual blood pressures highlighted or flagged.
